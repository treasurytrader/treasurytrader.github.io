VWAP WAVE
Principles
Trading isn’t an exact science—precision isn’t the goal. We aim for
well-reasoned decision-making, not perfection.
The market tends to persist in its current behavior rather than
abruptly changing direction. Instead of predicting shifts, we align
with prevailing market conditions. Trade based on what you see, not
what you hope.
When price holds or re-enters the VWAP value area, it often
gravitates toward the VWAP. If it moves beyond that level, the next
likely target is the opposite end’s value band.
When price remains within or returns to VWAP value area, the VWAP
serves as a key magnet. If it fails to break through and accept,
expect a move toward the most recent extreme value band.
Trading within the VWAP value area is often choppy. Adapt your
approach to avoid unnecessary losses from false moves.
When price breaks out of VWAP value area, it typically seeks to
explore new levels in the breakout direction, often targeting a prior
value zone.
Not all trades are equal. The highest-quality setups emerge near
fresh contextual shifts—this is where the best opportunities lie.
Open Sauce

The VWAP WAVE strategy provides a structured way to interpret
market behavior, but not every scenario can be perfectly
understood. Embrace uncertainty where necessary.

VWAP Wave Setup 1
Price Discovery Continuation

G R O U P

Setup Criteria
Price breaks out of VWAP value area
Must show price “acceptance,” time or distance
outside of value
Entry is on backtest pullback of VWAP deviation band
Enter on first sign of strenth after backtest
Stop goes a few points above/below backtest candle
You can also enter on break out of value, but be
prepared for a rejection, rather than waiting for
acceptance
Note: let the trade breath, often times they will setup
to the tick, but many times they will also retest again

VWAP Wave Setup 2
Fade Value Area Extremes

G R O U P

Setup Criteria
Price is spending time inside of VWAP value area
Must show price “acceptance,” time or distance inside
of value
Entry is on first sign of weakness or rejection on test of
VWAP deviation band *area*
You can also get in on touch, or scale in at proximity
Stop goes a few points above/below testing candle
wick
Note: These setups can have tighter stops, a strong
break or even grind through the VWAP band is a sign to
get out

VWAP Wave Setup 3
Return to Value

G R O U P

Setup Criteria
Price breaks back into VWAP value area after spending
some time and distance outside in price discovery
Entry is on backtest pullback of VWAP deviation band
after price breaks into value and shows acceptance
You can also enter on break into value, but be
prepared for a rejection, rather than waiting for
acceptance
Stop goes a few points above/below testing candle
wick
Note: Often times these will not backtest, so the only
setup would have been on break into value area

VWAP Wave Setup 4
WVWAP Bounce

G R O U P

Setup Criteria
Higher Volatility days are better, with price going in
and out of value
Entry is on test of VWAP after price breaks into value
After test of VWAP, enter on strength in direction
away from VWAP
Stop goes a few points above/below testing candle
wick
Note: VWAP can be a choppy spot where big players
are getting in and out, expect traps and games here,
like a VWAP break and reclaim (another setup)
